## 💼 About Me

I'm a Python Developer with **5+ years of experience** building scalable backend solutions, automation systems, and process optimization tools.

Currently working at Accenture, where I lead the development of custom automation platforms that replaced tools like Microsoft Power Automate. This initiative eliminated licensing costs by migrating all workflows to Python-based solutions, reduced processing time by over 60%, and gave the operations team full visibility and control over their processes. It also freed the development team from operational ownership, removing the need to manage schedules, start/stop executions, or report logs.

I bring strong problem-solving skills, a business-oriented mindset, and a proactive approach to identifying bottlenecks and delivering measurable results.  
I thrive in multicultural, remote-first teams and have experience working in **agile, global environments**.
